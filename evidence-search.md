# Evidence search
## Inclusion criteria
* Cohort studies that measure association between interpregnancy interval and rates of pre-term birth, or low birth-weight, or infant mortality using conditional[ logistic regression analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_logistic_regression) or [propensity score analysis](Propensity score matching)

## Reconciliation tables
* [Comparison of included studies with prior systematic reviews](../../tree/master/reconciliation-tables/) (Not applicable to this review as propensity and conditional logistic regression searching not done prior to the Conde-Agudelo 2006 review.
