| Ball, 2014  |[25056260](https://pubmed.gov/25056260)| Low risk (all mothers in the time period included)   | Low risk as outcomes missing for < 2% of births (525 of 40,441) | Low risk |Low risk  |Low risk. Confounders tested included:<br>• Parity<br>•  "Outcome of the previous birth" |Low risk. Used conditional logistic regression to control for maternal factors |
| Hanley, 2017 |[28178044](https://pubmed.gov/28178044)| Low risk | Low risk | Low risk | Low risk | Low risk. Confounders tested included: maternal age at time of each delivery, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, history of perinatatal death | Low risk. Used conditional logistic regresion to compare to same mother|
